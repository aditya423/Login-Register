[Aditya Ghadge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-ghadge-7045805009/)

A secure PHP API to manage login and signup operations. This API protects from attacks like SQL injunction and XSS. Making development work easier for developers.

## How to use?
1) Download XAMPP to run PHP on your local server (localhost) from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2) Go to XAMPP Control Panel and start your Apache and MySQL server 
3) Click on Admin to see both the servers
4) Download this code
5) Go to MySQL server and click on New --> SQL 
6) Copy paste the code from login_register.sql and click on Go
7) Database login_register gets created and users table gets created
8) Copy the whole downloaded code and paste in C:\xampp\htdocs
9) Go to Apache server link will be something like this http://localhost/dashboard
10) Change this link to http://localhost/Login-Register/login.php 

### Note:
htdocs me jo folder paste kiya hai woh http://localhost/ ke aage type kardo (here it is Login-Register) you will see our all the php files then select any to see (I selected login.php here because this is our starting point)
